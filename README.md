# MiniProjects.java
Just an amateur's newbie projects.

All these files can be put in an IDE and they will run. 


  I looked at a udemy course for guidance. I ended up changing a lot of the code for the puzzle game. 
The link to it is https://www.udemy.com/course/java-python-game/.
The instructor had a lot of repitition in his code so I made a couple changes with loops. I also made the frame more customized. 
The functionality for the instructor's game was also a little poor, as the space generated wasn't random, which made it not a game. 
Overall, I feel like the puzzle game is great for showing my use of arrays, objects, conditionals, and loops.
The starship game I'm having trouble following making, which is why a lot of the files are empty. More on that soon hopefully
